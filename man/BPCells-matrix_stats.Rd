\description{
Calculate matrix stats
}
\details{
The statistics will be calculated in a single pass over the matrix,
so this method is desirable to use for efficiency purposes compared to
the more standard rowMeans or colMeans if multiple statistics are needed.
The stats are ordered by complexity: nonzero, mean, then variance. All
less complex stats are calculated in the process of calculating a more complicated stat.
So to calculate mean and variance simultaneously, just ask for variance,
which will compute mean and nonzero counts as a side-effect
